Setting up a level checklist:

-duplicate the template level to get started
-draw the map on the wall tile layer
-lay out enemies around the base (put them in the enimies folder)
-Lay out some points of interest (in the points of interest folder)
-Resize Astar so the pathfinding grid fits your map. Ideally the grid will be centered on whole numbers.
-Place some spawn points (in the spawn point folder)
-Place soem supply Caches (in the supply cache folder)

When you have a playable product:
-make sure there are no test player prefabs in the level
-Add the level to the build
-add the level to the level list in the Game manager
